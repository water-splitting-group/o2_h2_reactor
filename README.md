# Overview

This repository contains original data and analysis code for "Simultaneous in situ oxygen and hydrogen detection during photocatalytic water splitting".

The publication (open access) is available Link and you can directly access the PDF file Link.

`data_analysis` contains different python programs and excel files used for data analysis. Note that these programs use various files from experimental_data, hence these directory must be present to run most of the python scripts.

`documents` contains manuscript and supporting information.

`experimental_data` contains experimental data, both from photocatalytic experiments, and photocatalyst characterization.

`figures` contains figures that appear in  manuscript and supporting information.

`irradiation_setup` contains files and instructions to build the setup provided in the manuscript.

`labjournal_entries` contains electronic labjournal entries of all relevant photocatalytic and synthetic experiments, general protocols (including calibration procedures, standard procedures for in situ measurements etc.), design and 3D printing of the setup compartments, as well as the devices entries in the form of .pdf files.

Subdirectories contain separate README.md files which detail their contents.

We actively encourage others to work on this interesting new avenue in automatization, are happy to answer questions or comments and are open to cooperations in this field.
