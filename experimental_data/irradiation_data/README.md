Description of all photocatalytic tests is provided below.



General notes: In all experiments 25 mL of photocatalyst suspension with 0.5 mg/mL photocatalyst content was used. Overall, photocatalytic test consisted of 10 min pre-reaction baseline, 15 min irradiation, 10 min post-reaction baseline (unless specified).
